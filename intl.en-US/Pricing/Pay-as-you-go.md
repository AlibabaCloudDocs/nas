# Pay-as-you-go {#concept_p14_q1k_wfb .task}

This topic describes how to calculate pay-as-you-go charges incurred for NAS.

## Billing cycle {#section_ish_3g7_e9z .section}

Charges are incurred for the maximum used space of a file system within an hour and deducted from the balance at the next hourly interval. For example, if you receive a bill at 9:30, the bill includes the expenses from 8:00 to 9:00. The basic billing unit is one hour. Each expense is paid by the hour even if the usage time of a file system is less than one hour.

**Note:** Assume that you receive a bill at 9:30. However, the bill may only include the expenses of a period from 7:00 to 8:00 due to a system delay.
