# Overdue payments {#concept_71225_zh .concept}

If you have an overdue payment, you must pay the overdue amount immediately to avoid your service being suspended.

## Scenarios {#section_yk5_tt1_hfb .section}

You may experience an overdue payment condition in the following scenarios:

-   You choose to purchase storage packages to pay your NAS service. However, the storage packages do not have the required capacity and your account does not have sufficient balance to pay the additional fees.

-   You choose the Pay-As-You-Go billing method. Your account does not have sufficient balance to pay the fees incurred by your NAS service.


## Caution {#section_ymk_251_hfb .section}

When you have an overdue payment, the following events occur:

-   If you fail to pay the overdue amount within 24 hours, your NAS service will be suspended. The storage space that you are using is still incurring fees while your NAS service is suspended. Consequently, these charges will be added to the overdue amount.

-   After you receive an overdue payment reminder, you will have 24 hours to pay the overdue payment.

-   If your NAS service is suspended due to an overdue payment, you will have 15 days to pay the overdue payment and resume normal service.

-   If you do not pay the overdue amount within 15 days, Alibaba Cloud assumes that you no longer require the NAS service. Consequently, your storage spaces will be released and the data in the storage spaces will be permanently deleted.
