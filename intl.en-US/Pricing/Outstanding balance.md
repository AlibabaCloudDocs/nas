# Outstanding balance {#concept_71225_zh .concept}

This topic describes when an outstanding balance exists in NAS. It also describes the next steps to perform.

## Scenarios {#section_yk5_tt1_hfb .section}

An outstanding balance occurs when you encounter the following issues in NAS:

-   You have purchased a storage package. However, the used space of a file system exceeds the quota of the storage package and the balance of the current account is insufficient.
-   The balance of the current account is insufficient and no storage package is available.

## Precautions {#section_ymk_251_hfb .section}

If the NAS service is in arrears, take note of the following:

-   If you fail to pay the outstanding balance within 24 hours, your NAS service will stop. The storage space that you occupy will still incur charges within the 24 hours, and the outstanding balance will continue to increase.
-   We recommend that you pay the outstanding balance within 24 hours to ensure business continuity.
-   If you fail to pay the outstanding balance within 24 hours, your NAS service will stop. If you add funds to pay the outstanding balance within 15 days, NAS is restarted.
-   If you fail to pay the outstanding balance within 15 days, all resources are released and related data is lost.
