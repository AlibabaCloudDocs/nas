# Manage LDAP users {#concept_cxp_3w2_2hb .concept}

Cloud Paralleled File System \(CPFS\) allows you to configure user-created Lightweight Directory Access Protocol \(LDAP\) services to control user access to CPFS file systems.

LDAP is used to provide directory services.

You can view the basic information of a file system on the File System Details page. Additionally, in the Access Control section of the page, you can click **Add LDAP** to configure the LDAP service.
