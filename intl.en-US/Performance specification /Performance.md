# Performance {#concept_jwf_xw2_2hb .concept}

The performance of Cloud Paralleled File System \(CPFS\) linearly expands.

As a cloud-based parallel file system, CPFS provides a throughput of hundreds of Gbit/s, an IOPS of millions, and sub-millisecond level latency. The bandwidth and IOPS corresponding to each specification are listed as follows:

|Specification|50 TB|100 TB|150 TB|...|
|-------------|-----|------|------|---|
|Throughput|5 Gbit/s|10 Gbit/s|15 Gbit/s|...|
|IOPS|350,000|700,000|1,000,000|...|
