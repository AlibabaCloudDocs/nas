# How can I stop being charged for NAS? {#concept_1375310 .concept}

This topic describes how to stop being charged for Network Attached Storage \(NAS\).

For business continuity, you cannot disable the NAS service.

If the NAS service is no longer used, you can delete all mount points of each file system and then delete each file system. After all available resources are deleted, no charge is incurred by NAS at the next billing cycle. When the pay-as-you-go billing method is applied to NAS, you will receive a bill each hour.
