# What is a mount point and where can I use it {#concept_c5h_bg3_ffb .concept}

A mount point is the interface for computing nodes \(such as ECS instance, E-HPC, or Container Service\) to access a NAS file system.

Mount points define the network type of the computing nodes and the permissions required to access NAS.

One mount point can be simultaneously mounted by multiple computing nodes, enabling shared access.
