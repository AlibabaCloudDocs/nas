# Is there a NAS terminology {#concept_42180_zh .concept}

Alibaba Cloud NAS \(Network Attached Storage\) provides an infinitely scalable file system to store data for ECS servers, and primarily involves the following concepts:

-   File system: The file system is a NAS instance. You can mount the file system on an ECS server, E-HPC, or Container Service, and then use it like a local file system.
-   Mount point: A mount point is the entry through which a computing node accesses NAS. It defines what type of network computing node can access NAS, and what permissions are required to access NAS.
-   Permission group: A permission group defines NAS access permissions, including authorized IP addresses, read/write permissions, and user permissions.
