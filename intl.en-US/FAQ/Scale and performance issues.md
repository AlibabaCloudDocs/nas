# Scale and performance issues {#concept_fdd_31f_2hb .concept}

## What is the maximum performance specifications of Cloud Paralleled File System \(CPFS\)? {#section_ayy_31f_2hb .section}

CPFS can provide a peak bandwidth of hundreds of GB, an IOPS of millions, and sub-millisecond level latency. The bandwidth and IOPS change with the specification of a file system that you purchase. For a CPFS file system of 50 TB, it provides a bandwidth of 5 GB and 350,000 IOPS.

## How can I change the performance of a CPFS file system? {#section_nty_v4z_2hb .section}

After a file system is created, the capacity and performance of the file system are fixed. You cannot change the capacity and performance of the file system. However, you can upgrade the specification of an existing file system. The performance of the file system improves when you select a higher specification.
