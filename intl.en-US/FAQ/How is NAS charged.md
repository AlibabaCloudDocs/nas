# How is NAS charged {#concept_42178_zh .concept}

NAS storage can be charged as a Pay-As-You-Go service, or subscription packages.

-   If you select Pay-As-You-Go, fees are based on the actual usage.
-   If you select a subscription package, you can assign the package to a file system to cover usage. Any resource usage that exceeds the purchased capacity is charged at the Pay-As-You-Go billable level. You can upgrade or renew a subscription package during itâ€™s validity period, however, you cannot downgrade a subscription package.

For more charging information about NAS, see [Billing method](../../../../reseller.en-US/Pricing/Billing method.md#).
