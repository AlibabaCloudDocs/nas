# Storage types {#concept_61136_zh .concept}

NAS provides two storage types: NAS normal and Cloud Paralled File System \(CPFS\).

-   [NAS normal](reseller.en-US/Product Introduction/Storage type/NAS normal.md#)applies to distributed file storage scenarios and provides two product types: capacity type and SSD performance type.

-   CPFS is a parallel file system. It is now in the beta testing phase.


The following table describes the advantages and application scenarios of each storage type:

|Storage type|Advantage|Application scenario|
|:-----------|:--------|:-------------------|
| Capacity type

 |Large capacity and low cost|Highly scalable and cost-sensitive workloads, such as big data analysis, file sharing, and data backup|
| SSD performance type

 |Low latency and high IOPS|Random I/O intensive and latency-sensitive workloads, such as enterprise applications, website containers, and searching tasks|
| CPFS

 |Low latency, high throughput, and parallel I/O|Highly parallel applications and workloads with high I/O and throughput, such as high-performance computing|
