NAS provides three storage types: Capacity typeï¼ŒPerformance type and Extreme type.

The following table describes the advantages and application scenarios of each storage type:

|Storage type|Advantage|Application scenario|
|:-----------|:--------|:-------------------|
| Capacity type

 |Large capacity and low cost|Highly scalable and cost-sensitive workloads, such as big data analysis, file sharing, and data backup|
| Performance type

 |Low latency and high IOPS|Random I/O intensive and latency-sensitive workloads, such as enterprise applications, website containers, and searching tasks|
| Extreme type

 |Extra-low latency and high IOPS|High-performance Web sites, DevOPS, code hosting and CI integrated environments.|
