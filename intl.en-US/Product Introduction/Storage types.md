# Storage types {#concept_61136_zh .concept}

NAS provides the following storage types to meet your needs: NAS Capacity, NAS Performance, and NAS Extreme.

The features, benefits, and scenarios of each storage type are described in the following table.

|Storage type|Feature|Benefit|Scenario|
|:-----------|:------|:------|:-------|
| NAS Capacity

 | -   Scalable capacity and linear throughput \(up to 10 Gbit/s\).
-   Maximum throughput of 150 Mbit/s for a single TB and a maximum latency of 10 milliseconds.
-   Improved performance, applicable to large-capacity and high-throughput businesses.

 |High capacity and low cost.|Scalable capacity and cost-sensitive applications, such as big data analysis, file sharing, and data backup.|
| NAS Performance

 | -   Scalable capacity and linear throughput with increasing capacity with a maximum throughput of 20 Gbit/s.
-   Maximum throughput of 150 Mbit/s for a single TB and a maximum latency that is in milliseconds.
-   Improved performance, applicable to businesses that require large-capacity and high-throughput.

 |Low latency and high IOPS|Random I/O access, data-intensive, and latency-sensitive businesses, such as enterprise applications, websites, and containers.|
|NAS Extreme| -   Maximum capacity of 32 TB. The initial bandwidth is 150 Mbit/s and can be scaled up to 300 Mbit/s.
-   A consistent latency of 100 microseconds.
-   Applicable to latency-sensitive businesses that handle large amounts of small files.

 |Ultra-low latency and high IOPS|High-Performance websites, DevOps, code repository, and CI integration environments.|
